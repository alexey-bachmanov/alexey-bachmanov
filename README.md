### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alexey, and experienced engineer, project manager, and boat nerd pivoting to a career in web development. This github is my personal portfolio, and contains all the portfolio-worth projects I've worked on. Note that I don't own most of my professional work, so it isn't featured here, but these projects are pretty representative of what I work on.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AWS certifications
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Next.js... and old sailing ships
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [alexbachmanov@gmail.com]
